# Hive Game Rules

## Game Setup and Basic Play
- **Players**: Two players, one with white pieces and one with black.  
- **Objective**: Surround your opponent's Queen Bee on all sides to win.  
- **Setup**: Each player takes all pieces of their color. Choose a starting player.  

### First Turn
- The starting player places one of their pieces in the center.  
- The second player places a piece adjacent to the first one.  

### Subsequent Turns
On each subsequent turn, you may either:
1. **Place a new piece**:  
   - Place it adjacent to one of your own pieces.  
   - It cannot touch an opponent's piece.  

2. **Move a piece already on the board**:  
   - According to its specific movement rules.  

### Queen Bee Placement
- You must place your **Queen Bee** on or before your **fourth turn**.  
- Until your Queen is placed, you may **only place new pieces** (not move).

## Important Rules
- **The Hive**: All pieces must remain connected, forming a single, contiguous hive.  
- **Freedom of Movement**:  
  - A piece cannot move if doing so would split the hive.  
  - Pieces must be able to physically slide into their destination space.  
- **Piece Stacking (Beetle rule)**:  
  - Beetles can climb on top of other pieces.  
  - The top Beetle determines the color of the stack.  
  - Pieces underneath a stack cannot be moved.
